## Overview
I chose this vis because I found it interesting, and because I know that pie charts are generally frowned upon.

## Achievements:
### Tech
Comparison mode automatically scales the width of bars on the graph to fit.

### Design
Made the bubbles for the initial vis scale logarithmically, to better highlight proportional differences over absolute differences.
